        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p> Nehemiah 9-10: This chapter is offered as a beautiful prayer to God. It also gives us the reader an overview of Israel's history from the exodus through the exile. The people recognize how the sins of their ancestors caused the Lord to hand them over to their enemies. Out of this humble position, the people renew promises to the Lord.</p>
        <p> Proverbs 20:14 Mimicks how goods are bought through bartering. By pretending that the product is not good, the buyer can purchase it for a lower price. Then the person goes off later and brags about their purchase.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Proverbs 20:16 One who "puts up security for a stranger" is referring to a person who takes on and is responsible for someone else's debt. It should not be done for a stranger or a wayward woman because neither can be trusted. So for the sake of accountability, the proverb is saying to take the robe of a person as collateral since they are being risky by vouching for someone untrustworthy.</p>
        <p>Proverbs 20:17 A reminder that sin may seem good or feel good for a moment, but its lasting impact can be devastating.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Nehemiah 13: After the renewal of the covenant with the Lord, Nehemiah goes back to serve the king of Babylon. He returns to Israel later, finding things in a state he did not like. He then goes about bringing reform and rebuking those in sin. The book ends on a low note, but Nehemiah is diligent in his prayers to the Lord, asking God to remember the good things he has done.</p>
        <p>2 Corinthians 5:5 As believers, the Holy Spirit lives inside of us and works to make us more like Christ Himself. But the Holy Spirit also points to the day when we will be completely transformed into the likeness of Jesus.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Esther 2: In this chapter we learn about Mordecai, who is part of a family line that was exiled from Jerusalem. At least 100 years have passed since the initial exile of the Jewish people, and this book is answering the question of "Does God still care about His people and promises to them?" This story shows God's hand on His people despite the Jewish people being scattered in far away places.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Esther 3: Haman is a descendent of King Agag, who was King of Amalek. The Amalekites and Israelites had been enemies ever since the time of the Exodus, when the Amalekites attacked the Israelites. After that attack, God said that He would "be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation" in Exodus 17. This explains Haman's hatred of the Jews, and Mordecai's refusal to bow down before Haman.</p>
        <p>2 Corinthians 7: Paul talks about how a previous letter he wrote brought the people of Corinth pain. There is a lot of speculation about what he is referring to here. He could be talking about the letter of 1st Corinthians, or there could possibly be an entirely different letter that he sent that was lost.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Esther 6: Even though God's name is not mentioned one time throughout this book, we see several coincidences start to take shape. When seemingly everything is going wrong for Esther and Mordecai, God seems to orchestrate events that will eventually be for the good of Esther and the Jewish people.</p>
        <p>2 Corinthians 8: In this chapter and in chapter 9, Paul is answering a question the Corinthians had about giving. They had started a collection of money to give to oppressed believers in Jerusalem, and Paul is now urging them to give fully to that effort.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Esther 8: Because the previous edict Haman had been sealed by the king, nothing could be done to undo its command. So the next best solution that Esther and Mordecai come up with is to encourage the Jews to defend themselves in order to not be destroyed.</p>
        <p>2 Corinthians 9: Paul gives further instruction to the Corinthians on how and why they ought to give. Paul ties the giving of Christians to the generosity of God: God in His great generosity gave us an indescribable gift (v. 15), so out of our gratitude we give generously so as to result in thanksgiving to God. God is ultimately the One Who gives us everything we need (v.8), so giving is a way to express our trust and faith that God cares for us.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Esther 9: The Jews are able to defend themselves and destroy the Amalekites, just as the Lord had instructed them to do centuries earlier. The last time the Israelites had fought the Amalekites is when King Saul had led them into battle. After the battle, King Saul plundered the people which displeased the Lord, causing Him to punish Saul by not allowing him to be king and giving the kingship to David. Having learned from that historical account, Mordecai and the Jews do not plunder the people that they destroy.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 1: We would highly encourage you to watch the Bible Project Job video today. You may even need to refer back and watch it again over the next few weeks as we journey through the book of Job. The tagline that the Bible Project gives for the book of Job, "an invitation to trust God's wisdom" is a great way to view this book. Job is the beginning of a set of books called "Wisdom Literature" including Job, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes (and some people include Psalms and Song of Solomon in this list as well).</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>2 Corinthians 10: Some have wondered if 2 Corinthians 10-13 is an addition or even a separate letter compared to the first nine chapters of the book. The reason for this is that Paul's tone changes and becomes much more intense in these final chapters compared to the beginning. There is no evidence that says they are two different letters joined together, but there is speculation that perhaps Paul received information from Corinth while writing this letter that caused him to shift his letter to addressing those who continue to slander his ministry. This group of people claim that Paul is bold when writing his letters, but timid when he is with the people of Corinth in person.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 5: The first friend to try and give Job wisdom is his friend Eliphaz. Despite trying to be a comfort to Job and offer him advice in verse 27 by saying, "we have examined this, and it is true. So hear it and apply it to yourself," Job's friend Eliphaz is not helpful because he is accusing Job of wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>2 Corinthians 11: In an effort to clear his name of the slander being spoken against him, Paul will tell of his ministry and compare it to the ministry of others. In verse 1 he calls it "foolishness," because it seems like boasting, but it is the only way to counter the claims being brought against him.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 8: Bildad is much more blunt in his analysis of Job's predicament. Eliphaz implied that Job was a sinner, but Bildad cuts straight to his point that Job must have done something wrong to deserve the suffering that has come upon him and his family.</p>
        <p>2 Corinthians 12: At first glance, "the third heaven" can seem strange. However, at the time the sky was often called "the heavens," outer space was also referred to as heaven, so what Paul is describing is the place beyond earth and outer space. He is referring to the place where we will be with the Lord in paradise.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 9: This chapter is one of the most important chapters in the book of Job because we see Job's frustration that he wants to defend himself before God, but he cannot even bear to stand before God because God is too holy. His plea in verse 33 names the need that all of us have - the need for a mediator to go before God on our behalf.  Job 9:33 - "If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon us both, someone to remove God's rod from me, so that his terror would frighten me no more." Praise God that we now have that Mediator in Jesus Christ! He removed God's rod by taking the punishment we deserve, and now we don't live in terror or fear of God's wrath anymore.</p>
        <p>2 Corinthians 13: In ending his letter, Paul warns that he will be returning to Corinth for the third time and will deal with the people who have spoken slanderously against him. Finally, notice the trinitarian blessing at the very end of his letter. Paul ends almost all of his letters in a similar fashion, by invoking God's presence to be with the believers.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 11: Zophar's speech lacks compassion for Job's condition, as well as accuses him of mocking God. Job has expressed his frustration, but he has not mocked God. Job accuses Zophar's argument of being simple and not profound.</p>
        <p>Galatians 1: Unlike in his other letters, Paul skips a lot of the greeting language and jumps right into the reason for his letter. He is gravely concerned about the influence of Judaizers coming in and preaching a different gospel than what Paul taught the church in Galatia. In order to establish his gospel, he has to remind the people of his apostleship so that his authority is taken seriously.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 13-14: Job ends the first cycle of speeches in chapters 12-14. He once again expresses his desire to make his case before God and defend himself. Job is very upset with his friends and how they are handling his situation, and even says that someday God will punish them for their deceitfulness. He is very discouraged and is on a rollercoaster of believing God will restore him (14:14), and feeling hopelessness (14:19-22).</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 15: The issue with Job's friends is not always that what they are saying is wrong. James 1:15 is very similar to what Eliphaz is saying at the end of chapter 15 in verse 35. However, Eliphaz's only conclusion is that Job is wicked. He has not been willing to wrestle with why good people suffer. This inability to sympathize and think critically about Job's situation makes his words unhelpful, when they could otherwise be a wise saying.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Galatians 2: Paul writes in the end of chapter 2 to remind the Galatians that following the law legalistically will not lead to their salvation. If anyone teaches a gospel that elevates acts (like circumcision) above the grace of God, they are saying that Jesus' sacrifice was not necessary. But Paul is arguing that because of Jesus' sacrifice of dying on the cross, we also have died and now live again. His life is our life because of the grace He has extended to us. This truth is deeply important to Paul, causing him to confront and call out the hypocrisy of Peter and demand that he stop participating with the Judaizers.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 19: Job comes to a point of hope after much despair in verses 23-27. He comes to a place of being hopeful that even if it is not until after he dies, he will meet God as his Redeemer, not as the one who has brought such enormous pain and suffering into his life. Job warns his friends to not be found being judgemental or they themselves will be judged by God.</p>
        <p>Galatians 3: Paul asks a series of questions that point the Galatians to this truth- the Holy Spirit is the one who has saved them and will continue to work in them. God's work in their lives has nothing to do with their ability to keep the Old Testament laws.</p>

        <p>Galatians 4: Paul uses the example of children born to Abraham through Hagar and Sarah to demonstrate to the Galatians that they have been born out of faith through the promise of God (like Isaac born through Sarah). They have not been born into slavery to the law (as Ishmael was born through Hagar), and they should not put up with being bullied into following the law. Paul introduces the idea of being free children in Christ, which he will continue in chapter 5.</p>

        <p>Job 23: Job uses the metaphor of being tested by suffering and coming out as gold. Peter uses this same idea in his letter of 1st Peter, encouraging believers to persevere in suffering because it will cause their faith to be proven genuine.</p>
        <p>Galatians 5: After arguing his point that Christians are free because of the sacrifice Christ made - a free gift - Paul now reminds the Galatians that their freedom ought to glorify God and not themselves. By keeping in step with the Holy Spirit, Paul lists what kind of attributes will be grown in the lives of believers, popularly referred to as the "fruit of the Spirit."</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 25: Bildad does not have a lot else to add to his argument, so he keeps his comments brief. Missing from this third round of speeches is Zophar. He remains silent and does not add further to his case against Job.</p>
        <p>Galatians 6: One of Paul's last pointed statements towards the Judaizers who demanded new believers to be circumcised is summed up in verse 15, "Neither circumcision or uncircumcision means anything; what counts is a new creation." Only the power of Christ can bring about true transformation. No physical act of legalism can achieve any lasting change. Only becoming a new creation will have an eternal and lasting transformation in our hearts.</p>

        <p>Job 29: Job now gives a final discourse that will take place in chapters 29-31. In chapter 29, he grieves the honor and blessing he once had in his life. He starts off mourning the sadness he has over not being close with God, and describes how honored he was in his town and with his people.</p>
        <p>Job 30: Job shifts from recalling the former days of blessing in his life to lamenting the pain and suffering he has endured. Job's humiliation is evident as he describes the torment that came so suddenly upon him.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 31: This is the very end of Job's discourse and his final cry to God to hear him and respond.</p>
        <p>Job 32: Elihu is a fourth man present at the time of these arguments. He is angry with both parties- Job and Job's friends. His anger with Job is because Job focuses so much on himself, and does not focus on God being justified. He is angry with Job's friends because they were unable to succeed in debating against him, yet concluded with condemning him.</p>
        <p>Ephesians 1: Verses 3-14 are all one sentence in the original Greek language! This section is rich, filled with all of the blessings we have through the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The phrase "in Christ" and its variations are repeated ten different times. Unity is a major theme of this book, and Paul starts off this letter by underlining over and over that we are in unity with Christ.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 34: Elihu is concerned that Job was close to accusing God of wrongdoing, so he stresses God's goodness and justice.</p>
        <p>Ephesians 2: Paul describes in verses 11-22 how it is that Gentiles can be part of the family of God. In the Old Testament, there was separation between the Jewish people and the Gentiles, and Paul describes how that barrier has been demolished through the death of Christ. Christ Himself is our peace who can bring together the two groups (Jews and Gentiles) and make them one.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Psalm 109: This Psalm seems to fit well with our reading through the book of Job. David is being accused of things he did not do, and is calling on God to not be silent. Notice verse 4, where in the face of being accused by his friends, David turns to prayer instead of retaliation.</p>
        <p>Ephesians 3: After explaining that Jewish and Gentile believers are now one in Christ, Paul explains that God's plan and wisdom will be made known through their coming together and being the church. God had not fully revealed this plan earlier, which is why Paul refers to it as a "mystery." Despite being in prison, Paul's joy is evident in that he gets to be part of spreading this message to the people about God's plan for His church.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 37: Elihu finishes his discourse before Job and Job's friends. His words ins 37:14-18 are similar to the questions that God will ask Job in the coming chapters.</p>
        <p>Job 38: After hearing from Job and his friends, God finally speaks out of a storm directly to Job. Rather than answering Job about if he will be vindicated, God chooses instead to ask His own questions of Job. They are rhetorical questions, pointing to God's far superior wisdom compared to that of Job's or his friends' wisdom.</p>
        <p>Ephesians 4: This chapter leads to the second half of the book. The first half of Ephesians is about the gospel and how it establishes who we are in Christ. This second half of the book will describe how we live in light of that identity. Not only does this chapter continue to drive home the need for unity, Paul also encourages the goal of maturity. The imagery given of the body points to the need for both of these things- unity and maturity- in order for the church to be successful.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 40: Job has nothing to say to God after listening to God's first discourse. In this second discourse, God describes two huge beasts and how they are under his control.</p>
        <p>Ephesians 5: The idea of being "filled with the Spirit" implies that it is not a one time act, but something that will be repeated over and over. The evidence of being filled with the Spirit is four-fold: singing, making music, giving thanks, and submitting to one another. Just like those who drink alcohol and become drunk are referred to as "being under the influence," so "being filled with the Spirit" means that we are under His power, control, and influence.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Job 41: God describes the huge and terrifying "leviathan," showing with all its power, Job would never be able to subdue it. Only God could create and rule over such an animal. This ends God's answer to Job.</p>
        <p>Job 42: After being humbled to the point of not being able to speak or answer God earlier in chapter 40, Job now comes to a place of complete repentance. He acknowledges that he should not have challenged God, and accepts God's plan in all things. The Epilogue gives a window into life after suffering for Job, where God again blesses him with a rich and full life.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Isaiah 1: This first chapter is an introduction to the whole book of Isaiah. It outlines the offenses that Israel has committed against God, yet also tells of the hope for restoration to come. </p>
        <p>Isaiah 2: The Day of the LORD is a phrase that is used repeatedly (or referred to as "in that day...") that points to a time when God will judge all of the people of the world. During that time, He will either bless or bring about his wrath depending on how people have followed Him and His commands. It will be a dreadful day for those who have been disobedient, and it will be a time of celebration for those who have been obedient to Him.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Isaiah 3-4: These chapters bring judgement against Judah, outlining all of the ways the people's' actions have been offensive before Him. However, it ends with a hopeful picture of redemption for the people, in 4:2-6.</p>
        <p>Ephesians 6: Perhaps one of the best ways to stay unified as believers is to remember that we are in a battle not with each other, not with unbelievers, but with the powers of darkness. In order to succeed and overcome the attacks of the enemy, Paul tells the Ephesians what to put on to defend themselves. Paul uses imagery of what a Roman soldier would wear, and mixes it with ideas from Isaiah regarding the coming Messiah.</p>
