          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Ezekiel 3 - This chapter concludes Ezekiel's call to becoming a prophet of God. It seems that the supernatural things he sees and experiences match the intensity of what God is going to ask him to do. In 3:10, The Lord speaks to Ezekiel and says,  "listen carefully and take to heart all the words I speak to you. Go now to your countrymen in exile and speak to them."  Later in this chapter, the Lord will actually make it such that Ezekiel cannot speak anything other than what has been given to him to say.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Psalm 133 - Parents can all recognize the universal truth found in the first verse of this Psalm, "How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity!" Children living in peace together and not quarreling is a blessing to everyone around them. But this truth is not mean to be applied only to the nuclear family, it is meant for the family of God. The way the people of God treat each other should be all encompassing - just like the oil that completely saturated Aaron the High Priest from the top of his head to his clothing. </p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>James 3: This chapter on taming the tongue can feel rather hopeless, albeit true. We don't have to look far back in our lives to see how much damage each of us can do with speaking recklessly or thoughtlessly. "No man can tame the tongue" (v. 8) is a reminder that in and of ourselves, we are destined to fail as we reign in our mouths. However, our hope for change has never been found in ourselves. It is only in Christ and in looking to Him that we can hope to speak in such a way that is pure and godly.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>James 4 - As we read in the beginning of James 4 we can feel the weight of sin in our own hearts. The evil desires in each of us manifest in many ways, especially in our relationships with others. One of the most powerful verses in James is 4:6 -  "But he gives us more grace." Even after all that we do wrong, God extends His hand of grace all the more to us. Verses 7-12 show us how to grasp that hand of grace- by submitting to God and humbling ourselves before Him.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Ezekiel 12 - After telling the exiles everything God had shown Ezekiel in the visions, he now is called on by the Lord to act out the coming exile. The people are paying attention and asking what it means, so God gives Ezekiel the words to say. He explains that all of this doom is coming very quickly and will bring much suffering to the people.</p>
          <p>James 5 - The subject of swearing brought up in verse 12 is regarding taking oaths. James is encouraging believers to not be foolish and use God's name as a way of guaranteeing something. Rather, he is saying to just simply keep your promises.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Ezekiel 13-14 - Ezekiel turns now to calling out the sin of false prophets and idolatry among the people. The false prophets are saying the opposite of what God has told Ezekiel. They are claiming that peace is coming, and are deceiving the people. The final verse of chapter 13 shows how God desires to save His people from the deception that leads to death being spouted by these false prophets.</p>
          <p>1 Peter - Another great resource available to you as you read 1 Peter are the sermon serieses on the book of 1 Peter. The first sermon series is Unfazed (1:1-12), followed by Unmistakable (1:13-2:10), then Unfair (2:11-25), then Rethinking Relationships (3:1-22). These are all available on NewHeights.org/talks . The first sermon in the first series, Unfazed, gives a lot of background information on Peter and this book in general.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Ezekiel 16 - This allegory refers to Jerusalem as an unfaithful wife, and God being the faithful husband. It compares Jerusalem's idolatry to that of an unfaithful adulterous wife, as God outlines all of the countries Jerusalem has partnered with in their idolatry and wickedness. The ending of this allegory offers a glimmer of hope- God Himself will make atonement and establish an everlasting covenant with His people despite their inability to keep their covenant to Him.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Ezekiel 18 - The people living in Jerusalem are accusing God of being unjust as they suffer. They believe the reason they are suffering is because of the sins of their parents and generations prior to them. God answers and promises that "the soul who sins will die," and not bring judgement on the children of the wicked. However, the people living in Jerusalem are steeped in their own sin and God is calling for them to repent.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Ezekiel 19 - This lament is sandwiched in between two words from the Lord regarding the rebelliousness of the people. This lament was written and meant to be sung repeatedly (v. 14), and is about the fall of the royal family.</p>
          <p>1 Peter 2 - Peter makes many references to Scripture from the Old Testament, specifically from the prophet Isaiah. Peter shows how the foretelling of the suffering servant in Isaiah was fulfilled in Jesus. As we suffer in this world, we are following Jesus who set the perfect example for us.</p>

After hearing specific instructions, these admonishments are for all: live in harmony, be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble, etc. These things are all required in the hearts of believers, though they may be expressed differently depending on each individual's life circumstances.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Ezekiel 24 - A heartbreaking scene in Ezekiel's life is here in this chapter when his wife dies. The Lord commands Ezekiel to not mourn in all of the ways he (and all of the Israelites) would have normally mourned. Ezekiel's wife's death symbolizes the coming doom of exile, and Ezekiel's reaction shows how devastated the people will be when Jerusalem falls to the Babylonians.</p>
          <p>1 Peter 4 - This chapter continues one of the biggest themes in the book of 1 Peter-  suffering. One of the benefits of suffering is stated in the beginning of this chapter- it puts an end to sin. When we are in the middle of intense suffering, often times there is little space for evil and sinful things that don't matter. Suffering has a way of prioritizing our behavior and actions.</p>

          <p>Ezekiel 25 - This chapter begins a series of seven prophecies against seven different nations- the Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia (chapter 25), Tyre (chapters 26-28), Sidon (chapter 28), and Egypt (chapters 29-32).</p>
          <p>Psalm 139 - One of the most famous Psalms because it points to how intricately designed we are, and how intimately and personally God made each human. Not only does God know everything about us, He is also always with us.</p>

          <p>2 Peter - The overall themes in the book of 2 Peter are encouraging spiritual growth in the lives of believers, condemning false teachers and teachings, and directing believers to look ahead to the second coming of Christ. In chapter 1, he spends time defending his message, by pointing back to the Transfiguration (v. 16-18) as evidence of witnessing Jesus in all His glory.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>2 Peter 2: Peter refers to an Old Testament account about Balam, found in Numbers 22-24. Peter is comparing false teachers of his day to that of Balam- who desired money more than doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord. Balaam's story highlights how foolish it is to disobey God. Not only is Balam unable to carry out wickedness of cursing God's people, he is rebuked by his donkey. Peter wants to false teachers to recognize that God will not be mocked and there will be consequences for mistreating God's people.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Ezekiel 36: This is one of the most hopeful moments in the book of Ezekiel. God promises to take away the shame of His scattered people, and to make them clean and new. Their wicked deeds have made them dirty and caused them to have a heart of stone, and the Lord promises now to give them a heart of flesh. One of the great promises in this chapter is God's promise to put His Spirit in them, so they will be loved to follow His decrees and keep His laws. Without the Spirit of God inside of us, keeping His commands is impossible. We must be changed from our former selves and made new.</p>
          <p>2 Peter 3: Peter's letter ends with orienting believers toward what is to come- Christ's return. He reminds everyone that Christ's return is coming, and is only "slow" because of God's patience and desire for more to come to know and have faith in Him.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Ezekiel 37: Ezekiel is shown another vision- this time a valley full of dry bones where God prompts him to prophesy to the bones to come to life. God is promising to bring back His people to the land of Israel after they have been scattered.</p>
          <p>1 John 1: John's letter is combatting a heresy that was gaining popularity in the early church- Gnosticism. One of the main themes of this belief system is that anything related to the matter- especially physical bodies- is bad, while anything related to the spirit is good. John comes at this false belief immediately, insisting that Jesus' followers saw him, heard him, and touched him while he was on the earth. Jesus was fully (including physically) man and fully God.</p>

          <p>Ezekiel 40: Ezekiel is shown a vision of the temple, completely restored. He is led through the vision by a man, where he goes from place to place seeing the different spaces in the new temple.</p>
          <p>1 John 2: John is also the writer of Revelation, the final book of the Bible.  It is fascinating to see that even before John wrote the book of Revelation full of prophecies about the end times, he already had an understanding that we are living in "the final hour." He is aware of antichrists and false teachers that would love to lead people astray in these end times.</p>

          <p>Psalm 144: This Psalm begins with a holy tension in our faith- God preparing us practically for war (the Lord...trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle) in verse 1, and also fully acknowledging that God is the One who protects us, shields us, and ultimately fights our enemies in verse 2. Both are true in our faith- God equips us and fights for us.</p>

          <p>Ezekiel 43: In reading through the Old Testament, we have seen God's glory fill the Tabernacle in the time of Moses, then the temple in the time of Solomon, and now we see it again in the vision Ezekiel is having of the new temple. God's presence returning to the temple is a promise and picture of full restoration for the people of Israel. After this, it will turn to show the full restoration of the priesthood- the Levites.</p>

          <p>Psalm 145: This is a wonderful Psalm to come back to when you want to praise God simply for Who He is. In prayer and praising God, often times we can linger on our own cares or problems, which absolutely have a place in prayer. However, there are times when praising God is just focusing on His attributes alone. This Psalm orients our hearts towards praising God in this way.</p>
          <p>1 John 4: This chapter is an expansion on the command from 1 John 3:23 to believe in the name of Jesus and to love one another. The first six verses here will expand on the first part- believing in the name of Jesus, and verses 7-12 will dive into how to love each other. It all culminates with the reason for this two-part command in verse 19- we love because God first loved us.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Daniel 1: As we begin the book of Daniel, it will be helpful to note that the first half of the book (chapters 1-6) is a historical account written by Daniel, while the second half is apocalyptic (chapters 7-12). Repeated twice in the book is the overall theme: "The Most HIgh God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men" (4:11, 5:21). As the Israelites are in exile in Babylon, God is still sovereign over every nation.</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>2 John: The "chosen lady" who John addresses his letter to could be a specific woman in a church, or it could be a reference to a  local church. The letter as a whole has language very similar to 1 John, with bringing the command to love and walk in obedience of God's commands. John writes to remind the recipient of these truths, as well as to warn against false teachers.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Daniel 6: One of the most famous stories of the Old Testament is found here, in God delivering Daniel from the den of lions. Darius' words at the end acknowledge and echo the theme of the book- God is the living God and He is sovereign in His rule. </p>
          <p>3 John: John writes this letter to his friend Gaius, encouraging him to welcome missionaries who are bringing the truth to churches. John brings attention to Gaius and Demetrius as examples of those who are exemplifying this well, but uses Diotrephes as an example of what not to do. </p>

          </ul>
          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Jude: Jude is the brother of James and the half-brother of Jesus. Neither James nor Jude referred to themselves directly as brothers of Jesus, instead calling themselves servants of Jesus. Jude writes to warn of false teachers who are evil and lead others astray in abusing the grace of God. This book's ending doxology, found in verses 24 and 25, are beautiful and powerful reminders that God is able to keep us from falling and failing when it comes to sin.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Daniel 10: There are many parallels in the book of Daniel to the apocalyptic New Testament book, Revelation. We will turn to Revelation in a couple of days. As you read through Daniel and then Revelation, you will see similar pictures and ideas. The vision Daniel sees here in chapter 10, is very similar to how Jesus is described by the apostle John in Revelation 1.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Daniel 11: Jesus also speaks of "the abomination that causes desolation" accounted in Matthew 24 and Luke 21. Jesus references this prophecy from Daniel, calling on those read this prophecy in Daniel to understand. Jesus was telling His listeners that these things Daniel was prophesying about must come to pass and signal the end times.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Hosea 1: Similar to Jeremiah and Ezekiel, Hosea is called on by God to demonstrate His word for the people. Hosea is obedient in his actions and in his speech to carry out what the Lord asked of Him. </p>
          <p>Revelation 1: A great tool for navigating the book of Revelation is using an outline of the entire book. You can find outlines in most study Bibles. As we make our way through this book, it will be a helpful roadmap to remember where we are at with different prophecies, and where we are headed.</p>
