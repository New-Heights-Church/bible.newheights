        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Exodus 13: God establishes a practice for the Israelites to teach their families for generations to come about His power to save.</p>
        <p>Exodus 14: The story of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea on dry ground is one of the most important moves of God in Israel's history. As we continue to read through the Bible, you will notice many references to this event, especially through Psalms and Isaiah. God delivers His people just in time to save them and bring about the demise of the Egyptians. Notice how God delivers His people despite their terror and lack of faith.</p>

        <p>Exodus 16: Manna is provided by God for the Israelites during their entire journey through the desert. God displays His care and faithfulness to the Israelites by providing food for them to gather six days a week. This chapter also introduces the idea of having a Sabbath day, which will be expanded upon later in chapter 20.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Exodus 17: The story of Moses listening to God to provide water for the people will become important later as we read Numbers 20. Moses does exactly what God says in this story, next time he will not. This chapter also introduces Joshua, who will become an important leader for Israel. He is a valuable part of Israel's army. As Joshua fights the Amalekites, Moses holds up his hands. Moses' posture is a picture of how the Israelites are to rely on the Lord for His help and deliverance from their enemies.</p>
        <p>Matthew 24: This is the last lengthy discourse Matthew records from Jesus. He tells of His second coming/return, referring to Himself as the Son of Man. He gives certain details about what it will be like, but says that no one knows when it will occur. In this teaching, Jesus describes a dark picture for how the world will be as the end draws near. Despite how bad things will get, He encourages people to live righteously and ready for when He will come again.</p>

        <p>Exodus 19: Chapters 19-24 outline the covenant God wants to make with Israel. In it, He promises to protect Israel if they will be faithful to Him by keeping His laws. Chapter 20 will give the most famous of God's commands, the Ten Commandments. This is God's covenant with Israel.</p>
        <p>Matthew 25: Jesus ends His final discourse with three different parables that give a picture of the coming judgement that will happen when He returns.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Psalm 22: Jesus quotes this Psalm written by David while He dies on the cross. Tomorrow we will read Matthew 27 where we will see Him use this Psalm to describe the agony in His soul as He suffers for our sins. It is not only a powerful window into Jesus' loneliness on the cross, but it is a reminder of how well He knew the Bible and relied on God's Word when He was in pain and suffering.</p>
        <p>Matthew 26: This chapter moves rapidly through the events leading up to Jesus' crucifixion. Notice in the very beginning how Jesus predicts His death to His disciples once more, though they still can't grasp what He is saying.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Psalm 22: In verse 18 we will read a prophetic description of the suffering Jesus is to experience. As you read Psalm 22 and then Matthew 27, look for the detailed fulfillment of what David prophesied about a thousand years earlier about Jesus' death and suffering.</p>
        <p>Matthew 27: Matthew takes great care to describe what happens to Jesus' body following His death. He is very clear about what happened to it, so that no one can argue about the coming resurrection, which he mentions in Matthew 28.</p>

        <p>Matthew 28: Matthew finishes his account of Jesus' life with telling of His resurrection and final words. Jesus' promise of "surely I am with you always" reflects His name given to His mother Mary in the beginning of this book. Immanuel- God with us.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Exodus 28: God now begins to detail what Aaron's role (and the role of the subsequent priests) will be and look like. Much time is given to explain the garments the priests are to wear.  The garments were worn by the priests to "give dignity and honor" (v. 2). An ephod is a sleeveless vest worn by the high priest.</p>
        <p>Proverbs 8:12-13: Verse 13 tells us four things God hates, through the voice of Wisdom. If God hates them, we should do all we can to avoid them. </p>

        <p>A note on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Exodus 29-30: The books of Exodus and Leviticus are filled with instructions on what the people of God are to do that would allow them to have fellowship with God. God is so holy yet so loving to His people that he provides commands by which they can have fellowship with and atonement (covering for their sins) from God. As we read Exodus and Leviticus with all the ceremonial commandments to have a relationship with God, we should be reminded that because of Christ, we have instant and permanent access to God through Christ. </p>
        <p>Proverbs 8:14-26: Remember as you read that this is the voice of Wisdom. The author of Proverbs is sharing how living wisely often results in rich blessings.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Exodus 32: This chapter is the heartbreaking story of the Israelites rebelliously disobeying God by worshipping an idol in the form of a calf. Notice verse 4 where Aaron says "These are the gods [or this is the god] who brought you out of Egypt." They could not imagine worshipping a god they could not see. Some commentators suggest they weren't ignoring God or changing gods. But they wanted a visual representation of God. They grew up in a culture with visual representations for their gods (Egypt), and they wanted to imitate that behavior. Two chapters earlier, the second commandment was given (to have no image or idol of anyone or thing that you worship.) Likely, they weren't attempting to reject God, they just wanted to make God in an image they could embrace (which certainly is rejecting God). Remember that the last we had read about the story of the Israelites was in chapter 24, where they agreed to follow God's laws. </p>
        <p>Psalm 23: This is one of the most famous Psalms. Written by David, it is a beautiful work of poetry. If you are familiar with this Psalm, try reading it in a different version of the Bible in order to hear the words in a fresh way.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Exodus 34: When Moses had come down from Mt. Sinai and discovered the Israelites worshipping the golden calf, he had destroyed the first set of stone commandments given to him by God. This chapter is the renewal of the covenant, where God again states His laws, and Moses writes down the Ten Commandments again on the stone tablets.</p>
        <p>Mark 2: In verses 23-28 Jesus references a story about David found in 1 Samuel 1:21-26, where David's men eat bread set aside for the priests. Jesus is reminding the people that the Sabbath was given by God to His people for their benefit. Religious leaders had tried to add more requirements and rules to the Sabbath, making the Sabbath something that it was not intended to be by God.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Exodus 35: Exodus 35-39 will sound familiar to you because it is repeated information from chapters 25-28. This repetition is a writing style used by authors to help their listener remember what was said, and to show that Moses and the leaders (in this case) did it exactly as God instructed. </p>
        <p>Mark 3: Jesus' response in verses 33-34 regarding his mothers and brothers is expressing that being in Jesus' spiritual family is more important than being in physical families. Those who obey God are part of His family and will reap the benefits of belonging to Him.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Psalm 25: This Psalm is a powerful Psalm to read and pray when going through hard times. Whether the hardship is caused by our own doing and sin or by the sins of other people, both of these are covered in this Psalm. The writer David ends the Psalm what he typically does in his Psalms of lament. He expresses his hope is in God, even with the difficulties surrounding him.</p>
        <p>Mark 4: So far in the book of Mark, we have seen Jesus' power displayed through miracles. Now, we will move into the teachings from Jesus. As you read these parables, keep in mind that parables usually have one main point. Not every element in a story has significance, so look for the main point Jesus is conveying.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Exodus 40: Exodus ends with the completion of the Tent of Meeting, and God's glory comes and fills the Tent. Now God will be with and travel with the Israelites wherever they go, as He leads them into the Promised Land.</p>
        <p>Mark 5: In this chapter we will see Jesus telling some to spread the stories of His miracles (v. 19), and some to keep quiet about it (v. 43). The reason for this often has to do with where the people are located. When Jesus heals the demoniac, they are in a Gentile village where there is no threat of people trying to kill Jesus. But in the case of the little girl, they are in Galilee where He has become very well known by the people and a threat to the religious leaders.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Leviticus 1: We recommend that you take the time to watch the Bible Project video about Leviticus, because it will help keep all of the different elements of the book (offerings, festivals, purity laws, etc.) organized in your mind as you read. These first two offerings (burnt and grain) were voluntary acts of worship. They were a way to express devotion to God.</p>
        <p>Proverbs 9:11-12: Just a reminder that Proverbs are principles for living rather than promises for life. These verses are good examples of that. </p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Leviticus 3: The fellowship offering was also called a peace offering. This offering symbolized peace between God and His people. Because the person offering the sacrifice ate part of the sacrifice with the priest and others, this is why it was called the fellowship offering.</p>
        <p>Proverbs 9:13-18: Notice how the call from Folly is the same as the call from Wisdom in verse 4. But in the end, what Folly offers is stolen and leads to death.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Leviticus 5: Yesterday and today we will read about the sin offering and guilt offering. The basic difference between the two offerings is that a guilt offering was required when restitution could be made. An example of this would be if something was stolen. The person who had stolen would be required to return the goods, along with 20% more. A sin offering was for the cases where restitution was not possible.</p>
        <p>Mark 6: In verses 5-6 we read that Jesus could not do any miracles in Nazareth, and that He was amazed by the lack of faith in that town. The issue here is not that He could not do miracles because of a lack of power, but that He would not do them because of their unbelief in Him.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Leviticus 7-8: Chapter 7 ends the section on offerings, and we move now into Moses ordaining Aaron and his sons as priests of the people. The priests have a special role - representing the people to God, and God to the people. They are mediators between God and God's people, a role that will no longer be needed once Christ has died (1 Timothy 2:5-6).</p>
        <p>Mark 7: Jesus' reply can seem harsh, but He is bringing to the surface the reality that Israel was God's people, but He illustrates God's mercy is far broader than the nation of Israel. What Jesus is illustrating, Paul and Peter will be loudly proclaiming after the death and resurrection of Jesus. </p>

        <p>Leviticus 9: At the end of this chapter, we see God's presence and pleasure displayed as He accepts this offering from Aaron by sending fire.</p>
        <p>Leviticus 10: The story of Nadab and Abihu's deaths shows the people God's utter holiness. The priests must take their role very seriously, being careful to keep all of God's commands.</p>
        <p>Psalm 29: After reading the past couple of Psalms crying out to God for help, Psalm 29 is a song of praise to God for all that who He is, reflecting on His power and majesty.</p>
        <p>Mark 8: Peter's answer of calling Jesus the Christ is what Mark has been leading towards in His account. Mark's accounts of miracles and teachings of Jesus have led to this moment- and Peter's announcement shifts the book now to Jesus' coming crucifixion and resurrection.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Leviticus 11: Chapters 11-15 detail God's requirements for clean and unclean. Keep in mind as you read that the purpose of the laws is for Israel to be a holy nation unto God, distinct from the surrounding nations. The word "holy" is used more times in Leviticus than in any other book of the Bible. As you read this book, look for this theme. It is all about being set apart, being distinct. </p>
        <p>Mark 9: The story of the disciples being unable to heal the boy with a demonic spirit points out two main things: Jesus requires faith from those who ask things of him (the boy's father), and His disciples must rely on Him for power, not relying on themselves to deliver miracles.</p>

        <p>Mark 10: Jesus looks at the rich young man with love before He instructs the man on how to live. Jesus' intent is to free the man from his greater love of things than his love for God.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Leviticus 16: The Day of Atonement is a sacred day where the Israelites are to rest, fast, and go through specific sacrificial rituals. This ceremony atoned (covered over) the sins of the priests, people, and purified the Holy Place. This day foreshadows what Jesus would ultimately accomplish on the cross. His sacrifice atoned for sin once and for all.</p>
        <p>Proverbs 10:10: Winking maliciously is the idea of being sly and not forthright with the truth. It is listed three different times in the Proverbs as a description of a villain and scoundrel.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Leviticus 22: At the end of different sections of God's instructions on holy living, you will see Him say "be holy as I am holy," and reminds the people of what He has done for them. God is telling the people over and over who He is and what He has done for them. Their conduct is a response to who Him and honors all that He has done on their behalf. And each command for living is to serve as a reminder that we are to be distinct, belowing to God (holy). </p>
        <p>Psalm 32: A "maskil" is a type of Psalm that gives instruction on how to live in a godly manner. There are 12 other Psalms with the title of "maskil."</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Leviticus 23: Feasts were a time of celebrating God- who He is and what He has done for the people. After reading much about how to live righteously and stay away from sinful behaviors, consider how God also called the people towards celebrating and joyful living.</p>
        <p>Leviticus 24: "An eye for an eye" is a well-known saying from the Bible. It was not often practiced literally by the Israelites. The principle of the law was that the punishment ought to fit the crime. Jesus quotes this in His famous sermon on the Mount.</p>
        <p>Proverbs 10:17: A reminder that others are watching and are influenced by how we live our lives. Our obedience to God matters for our sake and the sakes of others.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Leviticus 26: God expresses His desire to bless the Israelites if they will obey His commands, then goes on to explain what punishments will occur if they are not obedient to Him. See in verses 11-12 how God is operating out of the covenant He made with the Israelites- He promises to be their God and for them to be His people.</p>
        <p>Mark 14: Beginning in verse 12, the rest of this chapter goes through the details of the night Jesus is arrested. Notice how many predictions Jesus makes- being betrayed by Judas, Peter disowning Him, and the disciples falling away- and how quickly they are fulfilled.</p>

        <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
        <p>Numbers 1: Numbers begins with taking a census. The purpose of this particular census is to record how many men were able to serve in the Israelite army. The Levites were not included in this count because they were to upkeep the tabernacle and perform the ceremonies given by God. The book begins and ends with a census, and what we will find is that although an entire generation will die in the wilderness, out of God's mercy, a whole new generation will replace them to enter the Promised Land, and God's promise to Abraham will continue to be upheld by God.</p>
