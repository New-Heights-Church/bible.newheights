          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Isaiah 65 - The rejection of God by His people (the Jews) is sad, but it is mixed with the joy of the door opening for us, as Gentiles, to have a relationship with God. Although we don't rejoice in the Jews rejecting God, we are thankful we are able to have a relationship with Him in spite of not being Jews (v. 1). This chapter also has the comments about a New Heaven and a New Earth. Is this about the eternal state or about Jerusalem being at peace in this lifetime? Both views have some struggles in these verses.</p>
          <p>Isaiah 66 - The study of eschatology (future things) is highly debated among Christians. And the reason is - passages like this are not easy to interpret. What I would encourage you to consider is that God is the ruler of the world and he controls the end of all things as well as the here and now. He deserves to be worshipped. </p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>The Book of Jeremiah - Jeremiah was an Israelite priest who lived and worked in Jerusalem during the final decades of the Southern Kingdom (you read about this in 2 Chronicles and the books of the Kings). He was called as a prophet to warn Israel of the severe consequences of breaking their covenant with God through idolatry and injustice. He predicted the empire of Babylon would come to destroy Jerusalem and carry them into exile. And sadly, his words became reality. He lived through the siege and destruction of the city and witnessed the exile to that place (2 Kings 24-25). Throughout Jeremiah, we will walk you through the outline to help you follow along with the book. The notes come primarily from three study Bibles (ESV Study Bible, NIV Study Bible, Zondervan Study Bible).</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 1 - This is an introduction to Jeremiah and the setting and themes of the book.</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 2 - The next five chapters contain five related messages. In this chapter (through 3:5), we have the first message: Israel is a faithless spouse.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>A bit more about the book of Jeremiah - This book came into existence in a really interesting way. Chapter 36 tells us that after 20 years of preaching in Jerusalem, Jeremiah was prompted by God to collect all his sermons, poems, and essays and commit them to writing. He did just that by employing a scribe named Baruch, who wrote down and compiled all the material into a scroll. Baruch also gathered lots of stories about Jeremiah, and linked all the pieces together.  This is why the book reads like an anthology, or a collection of collections that have all been arranged to present this prophet as a messenger of God's justice and grace. The first six chapters are during the reign of Josiah in the Southern Kingdom.</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 3 - This is the second of five messages to begin the book (3:6-4:4). The people are being urged to repent. Judgment does not have to be the final word.</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 4 - This is the third of five messages to begin the book (4:5-31). There are consequences to a lack of repentance. And trouble will come from the north if you don't repent. The chapter ends by telling them that refusing to repent is foolish (vv. 19-31).</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Here is a bit more information about the book of Jeremiah - The first 24 chapters are Jeremiah's writings before the exile to Babylon. There is not much good news in the first half of the book (so prepare yourself).</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 5 - This is the fourth of five messages to begin the book. It is all about Judah (southern kingdom) and her unwillingness to repent. They are told that invasion is coming.</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 6 - This is the last of five messages to begin the book. This chapter is telling Israel that having rejected God, God has now rejected them. Hundreds of years of disobedience has resulted in this promised judgment.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 7-8 - The next four chapters of Jeremiah (7-10) are on the topic of false religion and idolatrous people. In 7:1-29, Jeremiah confronts the people as they enter the temple in Jerusalem. This is the place God told them to come and worship, yet mere attendance at his temple is not enough if they continually break His commandments. 7:30 - 8:3 talks about how bad things have gotten. They are actually slaughtering children in the valley next to the temple. The people of Israel were imitating the worship practices of nations nearby.</p> 
          <p>Jeremiah 8 - 8:4-9:26 is a reminder that if God's people repent, they will find forgiveness and mercy. But if they continue on their path, destruction is inevitable.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 9 - This chapter continues what began in 8:4, and is a reminder that if God's people repent, they will find forgiveness and mercy from the Lord. But if they are committed to their path and continue in their unrepentance, then their destruction is inevitable.</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 10 - This chapter breaks down this way: Israel has been constantly attracted to imitate the practices of the surrounding nations, especially their idolatry (vv. 1-16). They  are also told that exile is now inevitable, so they should prepare whatever they can carry (vv. 17-22). Finally, Jeremiah pleads with God for limits on His judgment (vv. 23-25).</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>This month, we are attempting to help you understand the flow of the book of Jeremiah. Here is what is coming: Jeremiah 11-15 is about the Israelites breaking God's covenant and the consequences that are coming.</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 11 - In this chapter, the covenant is broken (vv. 1-17), and a plot against Jeremiah is revealed (vv. 18-23).</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 12 - Jeremiah wants to know why the wicked prosper (vv. 1-4). He isn't the first to ask this question (Psalm 37; Psalm 73). Then the Lord rebukes Jeremiah (vv. 5-17). It is almost as if God is saying to Jeremiah, "This isn't about you. This is about my people who are rejecting me."</p>
          <p>Titus 1 - Be sure to watch the video to help you understand the book as you read it over the next three days.</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 13 - Several prophets were instructed to perform sign-acts and speak in parables symbolizing the Lord's plans for His people. This was particularly true of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, perhaps because both faced resistance from the people they were speaking to. The dramatic format engaged even those who did not want to listen to the prophet's words (vv. 1-11). The next section is short but important. It is a statement of judgment with no pity, mercy, or compassion (vv. 12-14). The chapter ends by tying the two parables together to say captivity is coming (vv. 15-27).</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 14 - The theme of this chapter (that continues in chapter 15) is the drought, famine, and sword are coming. These were told in the Mosaic covenant (Lev 26). Jeremiah is letting them know the coming judgment is because they have rejected God's covenant. </p>

          <p>We are providing some detailed clarity through the reading of Jeremiah to help you understand this difficult book.</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 15 - This chapter breaks down this way: God refuses Jeremiah's intercession for the nation (vv. 1-9), which leads Jeremiah to complain again (vv. 10-18), which brings God's rebuke (vv. 19-21).</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 16 - Jeremiah turns a corner here. He responds positively to God's rebuke and undertakes a new ministry. He announces the terrible times awaiting Judah (vv. 1-18) and the depths of human sin (16:19 - 17:11).</p>

          <p>Jeremiah 18 - Jeremiah compares people to a spoiled pot (vv. 1-17), and the people respond by renewing their opposition against him (vv. 18-23).</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 19 - Jeremiah continues to faithfully prophesy God's Word. It is straightforward and clear, but it will not result in the people listening or repenting. </p>
          <p>Jeremiah 20 - The persecution he faced (vv. 1-6) caused him to question God and his calling (vv. 7-18).</p>

          <p>Jeremiah 23 - Jeremiah finishes his confrontation of Judah's kings (vv. 1-8), and then confronts the false prophets (vv. 9-40). The prophets were supposed to proclaim God's covenant and make accurate predictions. They were doing neither one. </p>
          <p>Jeremiah 24 - Now Jeremiah turns to confront the people (chapter 24-25). In chapter 24, Jeremiah compares the people to figs. </p>
          <p>Hebrews 1 - Be sure to watch the video about the book of Hebrews. It is not the easiest NT book to understand. The video will be helpful.</p>

          <p>Jeremiah 25 - This continues Jeremiah's confrontation of the people. He directly tells them they will be exiled for 70 years (vv. 1-14), and then he announces Judah will not be alone in being recipients of God's wrath (vv. 15-38).</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 26 - Jeremiah wants the people to be sure to know that just because they have the Temple, doesn't mean they automatically have God's approval.</p>
          <p>Hebrews 2 - This great chapter ends with incredible encouragement about how Jesus suffered in a way that is amazingly helpful for us. </p>

          <p>Jeremiah 31 - The point of this chapter is that during the old covenant, God's people are experiencing disaster and exile, as Moses anticipated (Deut 30:1-5). But God will do a new work, as He promised in Deuteronomy 30:4, giving the people a hope and a future. Chapter 29 contained the best known verse in Jeremiah (29:11), but this chapter contains the best-known section of the book (vv. 31-40). The chapter breaks down this way: God promises Israel they will be His people (vv. 1-4), He will have mercy on them (vv. 15-26), and He will make them secure (vv. 27-30). That is followed by the promise of a new covenant (vv. 31-40).</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 32 - God tells Jeremiah to buy a field in enemy-controlled territory as a sign of confidence in the Lord's promise that the people will return to the land in peace and freedom. The chapter breaks down this way: God commands Jeremiah to buy land in Judah even though exile is coming. That feels like an irrational command (vv. 1-15), and leads to Jeremiah questioning God and receiving a firm response (vv. 16-35). And then God pledges to bring the exiles home (vv. 26-44). </p>

          <p>Jeremiah 34-45 outline: Chapters 2-29 were about Israel's current sins, and chapters 30-33 were about their future renewal, this section now talks about their final days.</p>

He declares God's faithfulness and Judah's unfaithfulness (34-35), Judah's rejection of God's word (36), Judah's last days before Jerusalem's destruction (37-39), Judah's futile rebellion against Babylon after the city's fall (40-41), and Judah's futile rebellion against God (42-45).</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 35 - This chapter is a continuation of chapter 34. While chapter 34 emphasized the people's unfaithfulness to each other, this chapter emphasizes their unfaithfulness to God. </p>
          <p>Jeremiah 36 - Judah's rebellion against God's word is further revealed. God has mercifully revealed his word (vv. 1-19), yet Jehoiakim rejected it (vv. 20-26). But God's word stands even when kingdoms fall (vv. 27-32)</p>

          <p>Jeremiah 46 - God will judge Egypt. Egypt is Israel's long-term foe and short-term ally. God will put Egypt to shame (vv. 1-12) and judge their god and kings (vv. 13-26). He then declares that God is with Israel (vv. 27-28).</p>

          </ul>
          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 47-48: These chapters fall in the section of chapters (46-51) about God's judgment coming to the nations. These chapters are about Philistia (chap 47) and Moab (chap 48). </p>
          <p>Jeremiah 47 - Although a short chapter, it is interesting. It is about the destruction of Philistia - one of Israel's most ancient enemies. The prophecy is given that Philistia will be destroyed by an enemy from the north. Excavations of Ashkelon in the region previously known as Philistia have revealed remains of the city by Nebuchadnezzar in 604 BC including a layer with much smashed pottery and a male skeleton with a crushed skull.</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 48 - This longer chapter is a prophecy of destruction coming to Moab, an enemy of God's people going back all the way to Abraham's time. Jeremiah claims God will judge Moab's arrogance and idolatry (vv. 1-10), make Moab ashamed of its god (vv. 11-20), silence Moab's boasts (vv. 21-44), and someday restore Moab (vv. 45-47).</p>

          <p>Jeremiah 49-50: This section (chapters 46-51) is about God's judgment coming to the nations. Today's chapters are about Ammon, Edom, Damascus, Kedar, Hazor, Elam (chap 49), and even Babylon (chaps 50-51).</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 49 - This chapter contains judgment for several groups or cities - Ammon (vv. 1-6), Edom (vv. 7-22), Damascus (vv. 23-27), Kedar and Hazor (vv. 28-33), and Elam (vv. 34-39).</p>
          <p>Jeremiah 50 - Babylon was the great world power during the second half of Jeremiah's ministry. Jeremiah predicts Babylon will fall, which happens in 539 BC. Jeremiah proclaims Babylon and its gods will be destroyed (vv. 1-10) because the people have sinned against God (vv. 11-16). He claims that God will gather and pardon Israel (vv. 17-20), but will make Babylon like Sodom and Gomorrah (vv. 21-40). </p>

          <p>Jeremiah 51 - This chapter continues the statement of judgment against Babylon (chapter 50). Here God promises He has not forsaken Israel (vv. 1-20). He is the Creator (vv. 11-23) who will destroy Babylon for Israel's sake (vv. 24-64). </p>
          <p>Jeremiah 52 - Jerusalem falls. The book ends by describing Jerusalem's fall and Zedekiah's blinding (vv. 1-11), the destruction of the Temple (vv. 12-23), the exiling of the people (vv. 24-30), and the continuation of the Davidic lineage (vv. 31-34). </p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Lamentations: Be sure to watch the video to help you understand this much-neglected book. Over the next three days, we will provide some outlines of what you will read so you can better follow the argument of the book. The outlines are from the ESV Study Bible, NIV Study Bible, and/or the Zondervan Study Bible.</p>
          <p>Lamentations 1 - The book begins with a description of Jerusalem's devastation (vv. 1-11) and reports of her calls for help (vv. 12-22). Jerusalem "speaks" in vv. 9, 11-16, and 18-22. A narrator "speaks" in vv. 1-9, 10-11, and 17. </p>
          <p>Lamentations 2 - This chapter emphasizes the totality of God's judgment of Jerusalem. The narrator describes the effects of God's punishment (vv. 1-10). Then a prophetic voice like Jeremiah's grieves the city's losses and counsels her to cry out to God (vv. 11-19). The chapter ends with Jerusalem asking God to see what she has suffered and to act on her behalf (vv. 20-22).</p>

          <p>Notes on what you will read today:</p>
          <p>Lamentations 3 - This lengthy chapter begins with the writer expressing his experience of suffering and God's faithfulness (vv. 1-24), and he responds to God's sovereignty and goodness (vv. 25-39). He then prays for renewal (vv. 40-47) and maintains confidence in God's love for him and Israel (vv. 48-66).</p>
          <p>Lamentations 4 - This shorter chapter divides into four sections: the suffering of Jerusalem (vv. 1-10), the punishing of Jerusalem's religious leaders (vv. 11-16), the power of Jerusalem's enemies (vv. 17-20), and the end of Jerusalem's suffering (vv. 21-22).</p>
